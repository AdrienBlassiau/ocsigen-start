(** Data types

    This module defines types used in ocsigen-start in multiple files. It
    gives a more readable interface (for example by using [Os_types.userid]
    instead of [int64]). Put all most used types in this file avoids to have
    dependencies between different modules for only one type.

[%%shared.start]

(** Type representing a user ID *)
type userid = int64 [@@deriving json]

(** Type representing a user. See <<a_api | module Os_user >>. *)
type user = {

  } [@@deriving json]

(** Action links *)
